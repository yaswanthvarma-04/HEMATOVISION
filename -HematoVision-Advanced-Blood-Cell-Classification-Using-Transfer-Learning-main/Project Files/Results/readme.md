This folder contains the evaluation outputs and sample predictions from the HematoVision Blood Cell Classification model.

## üìÅ Contents

- `confusion_matrix.png`: Visual representation of model performance across all 4 classes.
- `accuracy_plot.png`: Graph showing training and validation accuracy across epochs.
- `loss_plot.png`: Graph showing training and validation loss across epochs.
- `sample_prediction1.png`: Input test image along with predicted label (e.g., neutrophil).
- `sample_prediction2.png`: Additional example of a correctly or incorrectly classified image.

These results help in assessing the effectiveness of the trained model and provide visual evidence of the classification quality.
